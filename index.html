          <u>GETTING THERE / ACCOMODATION</u><br>
          We wanted a venue that also provided accomodation for people travelling for the wedding that was relatively close to Wellington. Martinborough is located in the Wairarapa. It’s about an hour car ride or you can train to Featherston from Wellington station and catch the bus to Martinborough, which links up to every arriving train. Unfortunately it’s hard to get back to Wellington in the evening unless you are driving so staying the night in one of the many bnbs/hotels is the best option.<br><br>
          We will be staying from the 30/01- 1/02 which is 3 nights, you are welcome to stay during that period to partake in pre and post wedding celebrations. We understand this is hard for some people as it’s during the work week, but hopefully we are giving enough notice for people to make arrangements and treat this like a mini break!<br><br>
          <u>ATTIRE</u><br>
          The wedding will be a garden party with no sit down dinner. Dress semi formal/cocktail.
          <br><br>
          <u>CHILDREN</u><br>
          Children are welcome to stay for festivities in the afternoon but we would prefer babysitters from 7pm onwards as the party starts. We want mum and dad to have a well deserved night out! Please let us know if you would like help getting in touch with a local reputable babysitter.<br><br>
